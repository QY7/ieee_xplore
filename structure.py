        "abstract":"An electrically small circular loop antenna with an isotropic radiation pattern to within \u00b1 1.9 dBi is described. The scalable design operated at the 1575.42 Megahertz Global Positioning System L1 frequency. Means are provided to separately adjust driving resistance and reactance. Common mode currents radiate beneficially as part of loop structure. As the radiation pattern is sufficiently spherical, the design permits wireless systems to operate without aiming or orientation. Applications may include radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, radiolocation receivers, tumbling satellites or personal communications.",
